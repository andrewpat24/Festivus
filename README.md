## SETUP PROCEDURE

### Setup postgres on your computer. 

OSX: https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac

Linux: https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/diy-it-guy/diy-a-postgresql-database-server-setup-anyone-can-handle/

### Create DB

Connect to psql db from your terminal.

> psql postgres

Create the database.

> CREATE DATABASE festivus;

Exit from the database. 

> \quit

Clone repository in your desired directory. 

> git clone https://github.com/andrewpat24/Festivus.git

Setup NPM 

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

Download dependencies

> npm i

Migrate the database model into postgres (this command must be run while terminal path is inside project)

> sequelize db:migrate

Copy .env-example and rename it to .env

Only DB_URL is in use, so just make that one by changing the username and password text. 

## Current design comps

Thanks to our friend lukas, we have designs!

## How the fuck does this all work? 

Take a look in package.json, 'npm start' runs a script which kicks off bin/www. 

Our app.js then builds the rest of our project by specifying our routes. 

Express application walkthrough:

What are routes? 
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

Let's go through our directories top to bottom: 
#### bin
* contains www which kicks off our app and gets our server running. If there're any issues with port number or specific server issues, look in here. 

#### db 
* This directory contains helper functions for psql. db.js creates our initial connection to the db which we reference in our helper functions. 

#### node_modules
* NPM is the node package manager, which installs packages locally into a project, specifically, into the node_modules folder.

#### public
* Where all of our client side shit gets loaded like javascript, css, style libraries, etc. 

#### public - libraries 
* Currently using [uikit](https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction).
* Still need to add jQuery, but hbs should be doing the majority of our logic. 

#### routes
* routes get used so our server knows what data to serve the user depending on the url. You can have multiple types of routes depending on GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/etc requests from the user. For example, you can make a post route on /deleteUserWithID:[id] to pass an id with the url parameter to delete that user. 

#### server
* this directory was automatically generated by sequelize. I don't know why the fuck they chose to automatically generate it if I don't have a server directory but whatever

#### server - migrations + server - models
* This allows us to automatically generate our tables when running sequelize db:migrate. 

#### views
* Contains all of our frontend templates for handlebars. The files get served up in our routes.
* layout.hbs gets built on every single page. That way things like headers, navbars, footers, etc can be placed on every page without us doing anything. 
* if you want to add any components directory, put it in here. 

#### .env (and .env-example)
* Contains all of our sensitive information like usernames, passwords, api keys, etc so it can be abstracted and not put up into github. 

#### package.json
* The scripts key is where you can check to see what scripts are available or where you can make new scripts for our project.
